# ABED-1pop (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics in 1 population)
ABED-1pop is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of a population of agents who play a symmetric 2-player game and, from time to time, are given the opportunity to revise their strategy.

ABED-1pop is implemented in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and fully explained at [this website](https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/abed-1pop/)

# ABED-1pop (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics in 1 population)
ABED-1pop is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of a population of agents who play a symmetric 2-player game and, from time to time, are given the opportunity to revise their strategy.

ABED-1pop is implemented in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) and fully explained at [this website](https://luis-r-izquierdo.github.io/abed-1pop/)

You are most welcome to extend the model as you please, either privately or by creating a branch in this repository. If you’d like to see any specific feature implemented, but you don’t know how to go about it, do feel free to email us and we’ll do our best to make it happen.
